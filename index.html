                <p>You said yes, but I figured it wasn't official till it was at least a little awkward! I also
                really wanted to make a website since weird nerdy stuff like that is fun for me.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Well, here goes!</h2>
                <p>...I mean there goes. I lost my nerve. Dang it!</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I suppose I'll just have to beat around the bush a little while.</p>
                <p>Ya know, our relationship has been pretty awesome!</p>
                <p>For 2 1/2 years I've been ever so slightly infatuated with you.
                  Over that time we've gotten to know, love, and trust eachother (with a little flirting here and there).
