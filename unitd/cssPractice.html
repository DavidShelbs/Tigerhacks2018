					To select by element, you simply need to use the element's tag name. For example, to select the paragraph tags on the page you would simply use p followed by the curly brackets.
					Selecting by element in CSS is the least specific form of selection in CSS.
					The style used when selecting by element will be used when there are no other styles overriding the style given.
					This method is the easiest to override on an element so be careful.

					<h2>Class selector</h2>
					<p>Selecting by class name</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					To select elements by class name, you use a period. For example if there are elements with the class name wrapper, you would use .wrapper followed by the curly brackets.
					Selecting by class in CSS is a great way to make sure different elements look a certain way if they are given that class name.

					<h2>ID selector</h2>
					<p>Selecting by ID</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					To select elements by ID, you use a pound sign(aka number symbol, aka hashtag). For example if there is an element with the ID of foobar, you would use #foobar followed by the curly brackets.
					Selecting by ID in CSS is a great way to style a specific element on a page without worrying about messing with the way other elements are styled..
